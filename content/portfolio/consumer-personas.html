                <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
                <p>Corporate consumer persona information had not been updated in over a year. Stakeholders began to forget about and/or neglect personas, especially when making design considerations.</p>

                <h3>SOLUTION</h3>

                <p>Refresh persona data with job seeker o*nets that were of particular interest to the business in the upcoming year. These o*nets were determined by a list provided by the marketing department of the most in-demand job titles for 2016.</p>

                <h3>PROCESS</h3>

                <img src="../../img/consumer-persona2.jpg" height="300" width="500"/>

                <p>As business needs changed over the past year, the research team began to see gaps in our persona data. Many of those gaps were in regard to the types of individuals we were not able to speak with when initially creating the personas.</p>

                <p>The research team asked the marketing department to supply us with a list of the most in-demand job seekers/users on our site for the upcoming year. From this list, we picked out o*nets/job titles that we were not able to speak with in our initial rounds of persona research. We then ran a series of persona interviews with those o*nets to see where, if at all they fall into our current persona landscape.</p>

                <h3>FINDINGS/OUTCOMES</h3>

                <p>From our research, we were able to refresh our persona data with business relevant and in-demand job seekers who everyone could easily identify with. Although the project was just recently finished, we have already seen an increase in our persona research usage from stakeholders within the company. We hope this renewed interest in the company’s personas continue and are spread further than they were before.</p>
